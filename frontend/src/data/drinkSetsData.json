I love the size of the bowls, and find I'm eating most things out of those. LOL The dinner plates are ginormous, and I typically end up eating off the dessert plates! They do make an impact aesthetically though, and I love them. :)"

They only cons I've found to them so far are that they are quite a bit heavier than I expected (I'm telling myself that makes them very durable) and they take up quite a bit more space in my cupboards than my previous set. I can't do anything about the former, but as far as the latter, after rearranging things a bit, I was successful in getting everything to fit. They are beautiful, and I'm excited to use them, especially since I wasn't even looking for them and simple serendipitously stumbled across them."
