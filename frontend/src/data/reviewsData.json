My only complaint is that the plates are a bit too big to stand up in the plate section of my countertop dishwasher, although I've found a workaround that suits. :) The paint is holding up great, the dishes are holding up great. I love the size of the bowls, and find I'm eating most things out of those. LOL The dinner plates are ginormous, and I typically end up eating off the dessert plates! They do make an impact aesthetically though, and I love them. :)"

            "text":"Like others have commented, these dishes came impressively well packed. The box they arrived in wasn't pristine, but my concern about breakage was unfounded. They only 'cons' I've found to them so far are that they are quite a bit heavier than I expected (I'm telling myself that makes them very durable) and they take up quite a bit more space in my cupboards than my previous set. I can't do anything about the former, but as far as the latter, after rearranging things a bit, I was successful in getting everything to fit. They are beautiful, and I'm excited to use them, especially since I wasn't even looking for them and simple serendipitously stumbled across them."
